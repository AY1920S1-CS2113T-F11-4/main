<span class="s0">=== Overall Architecture</span>
<span class="s1">This image shows the overall architecture of our program</span>

<span class="s0">image::</span><span class="s1">Architecture main.png</span><span class="s0">[</span><span class="s1">width = 500%</span><span class="s0">]</span>

<span class="s0">=== Main component</span>
<span class="s1">Main component has one class called </span><span class="s0">`</span><span class="s4">Duke</span><span class="s0">`</span><span class="s1">. It is responsible for the following: </span><span class="s0">+ 
</span>
<span class="s0">. </span><span class="s1">On startup: Initializes all components and sets up the correct file path so that the program correctly interacts</span>
<span class="s1">with the external txt file.</span>
<span class="s0">. </span><span class="s1">During runtime: Acts as an intermediary between the </span><span class="s0">`</span><span class="s4">Parser</span><span class="s0">` </span><span class="s1">class and the </span><span class="s0">`</span><span class="s4">Command</span><span class="s0">` </span><span class="s1">so that user input can be parsed</span>
<span class="s1">and then executed accordingly.</span>
<span class="s0">. </span><span class="s1">On shutdown: Interacts with the UI class to communicate the shutdown message to the user.</span>

<span class="s0">=== UI component</span>
<span class="s1">UI component contains all classes necessary to interact successfully with the user. The </span><span class="s0">`</span><span class="s4">Parser</span><span class="s0">` </span><span class="s1">parses input commands</span>
<span class="s1">from the user whilst the </span><span class="s0">`</span><span class="s4">UI</span><span class="s0">` </span><span class="s1">class handles all necessary dissemination of information to the user through </span><span class="s0">`</span><span class="s4">System.out</span><span class="s0">`</span><span class="s1">.</span>

<span class="s0">=== Logic component</span>
<span class="s1">This component contains all necessary classes that :</span>

<span class="s0">. </span><span class="s1">Are in charge of handling how all necessary information is internally stored within the program's runtime.</span>
<span class="s0">. </span><span class="s1">Alter the internally stored information whenever necessary (i.e when changes are made by the user).</span>
<span class="s0">. </span><span class="s1">Extract information requested by the user from the stored information and pass them back to the user through the UI</span>
<span class="s1">component</span>
<span class="s0">. </span><span class="s1">This is achieved through the two classes </span><span class="s0">`</span><span class="s4">EventList</span><span class="s0">` </span><span class="s1">and </span><span class="s0">`</span><span class="s4">Command</span><span class="s0">`</span><span class="s1">. </span><span class="s0">`</span><span class="s4">EventList</span><span class="s0">` </span><span class="s1">decides how information is stored</span>
<span class="s1">internally as well as how internal stored information is altered and/or extracted. </span><span class="s0">`</span><span class="s4">Command</span><span class="s0">` </span><span class="s1">commands the </span><span class="s0">`</span><span class="s4">EventList</span><span class="s0">`</span>
<span class="s1">class on what needs to be done at any point in time.</span>

<span class="s0">=== Storage component</span>
<span class="s1">This component contains all necessary classes that read and write external txt files. This is where all information is</span>
<span class="s1">stored while the program is not running. </span><span class="s0">+ 
</span><span class="s1">In particular, the </span><span class="s0">`</span><span class="s4">Storage</span><span class="s0">` </span><span class="s1">class directly reads from and writes to and external txt file in the data directory.</span>

<span class="s0">=== Commons</span>
<span class="s1">This component represent all other low-level classes required for the program to function. </span><span class="s0">+ 
</span><span class="s1">This includes classes like the </span><span class="s0">`</span><span class="s4">Event</span><span class="s0">` </span><span class="s1">class which is the abstract parent class for all the types of classes that</span>
<span class="s1">represent the different types of events(</span><span class="s0">`</span><span class="s4">ToDo</span><span class="s0">`</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s0">`</span><span class="s4">Concert</span><span class="s0">`</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s0">`</span><span class="s4">Exam</span><span class="s0">`</span><span class="s1">, etc.) a user can input as an entry in the program.</span>

<span class="s1">This image shows the sequence diagram when a user input &quot;delete 1&quot; is entered.</span>

<span class="s0">== Implementation</span>
<span class="s1">This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.</span>

<span class="s0">=== Calendar Table</span>
<span class="s1">The calendar table is generated from the </span><span class="s0">`</span><span class="s4">EventList</span><span class="s0">`</span><span class="s1">. It prints on the screen a table of calendar of 7 days</span>
<span class="s1">starting from a specified day, including the events within this time period. </span><span class="s0">+ 
</span>
<span class="s0">==== Sequence diagram</span>
<span class="s1">Below is the sequence diagram of calendarView.</span>

<span class="s0">image::</span><span class="s1">calendar_sequenceDiagram.png</span><span class="s0">[</span><span class="s1">width = &quot;800&quot;</span><span class="s0">]</span>

<span class="s0">==== How it is implemented</span>
<span class="s1">Given below is the sequential steps of how a calendar table is generated and printed.</span>

<span class="s1">Step 1. User enters </span><span class="s0">`</span><span class="s4">calendar</span><span class="s0">` </span><span class="s1">to start the initialization process of a calendar table with today as the starting day.</span>

<span class="s1">Step 2. The program checks the date of the given start day to generate a list of 7 days, starting from given day.</span>
<span class="s1">It also gets the day of the 7 days (e.g. Monday, Tuesday, etc). This sets the dates info of the table.</span>

<span class="s1">E.g. Example of a day and dates list</span>

<span class="s0">image::</span><span class="s1">DGCalendarTableDaysList.png</span><span class="s0">[</span><span class="s1">width = &quot;600&quot;</span><span class="s0">]</span>

<span class="s1">Step 3. The program find all events in the </span><span class="s0">`</span><span class="s4">EventList</span><span class="s0">` </span><span class="s1">that is within the 7 days,</span>
<span class="s1">and store them correspondingly into 7 queues, representing the 7 days. This is for further printing.</span>

<span class="s1">E.g. Example of an event list of 7 days</span>

<span class="s0">image::</span><span class="s1">DGCalendarTableExample.png</span><span class="s0">[</span><span class="s1">width = &quot;600&quot;</span><span class="s0">]</span>

<span class="s1">Step 4. The program now have all the information of these 7 days and is then able to print the calendar table.</span>

<span class="s0">. </span><span class="s1">It initiates an empty string to store all info of the calendar and for later printing.</span>
<span class="s0">. </span><span class="s1">It puts the header of the table into the string.</span>
<span class="s0">. </span><span class="s1">It puts the days of week and dates info into the string.</span>
<span class="s0">. </span><span class="s1">To add in events, each event takes 3 rows (time info, description, and dashes) to print. For each 3 rows,</span>
<span class="s1">there can be at most 7 events. The events are added per 3 rows. For each 3 rows, the program creates an array of 3 * 7</span>
<span class="s1">to store the details. Whenever there exists an event at the position of a day, details of the event will be added to</span>
<span class="s1">the corresponding 3 rows (1 column) of the array. The array is then added by rows into the string.</span>

<span class="s1">E.g. Example of a row of events stored for printing</span>

<span class="s0">image::</span><span class="s1">DGCalendarTableRow.png</span><span class="s0">[</span><span class="s1">width = &quot;600&quot;</span><span class="s0">]</span>

<span class="s0">==== Commands for CalendarView</span>
<span class="s0">- `</span><span class="s4">calendar</span><span class="s0">` </span><span class="s1">This prints the calendar table of this 7 days.</span>
<span class="s0">- `</span><span class="s4">calendar next</span><span class="s0">` </span><span class="s1">This prints the calendar table of the next 7 days.</span>
<span class="s0">- `</span><span class="s4">calendar last</span><span class="s0">` </span><span class="s1">This prints the calendar table of the last 7 days.</span>
<span class="s0">- `</span><span class="s4">calendar on</span><span class="s0">` </span><span class="s1">Allow the calendar to be printed after every command execution.</span>
<span class="s0">- `</span><span class="s4">calendar off</span><span class="s0">` </span><span class="s1">Not allowing the calendar to be printed after every command execution.</span>

<span class="s0">=== Check Free Days</span>
<span class="s1">CheckFreeDays is a command that allows the program to search for the next 3 days without any</span>
<span class="s1">events (except ToDos). </span><span class="s0">+ 
</span>
<span class="s0">. </span><span class="s1">When the user enters </span><span class="s0">`</span><span class="s4">check</span><span class="s0">`</span><span class="s1">, starting from the current day, the program</span>
<span class="s1">checks all the events whether any is in this day.</span>
<span class="s0">. </span><span class="s1">If not, this day will be added into a list.</span>
<span class="s0">. </span><span class="s1">Above process will continue until the list has 3 days, which will then be printed.</span>

<span class="s1">The following activity diagram shows how check free days is implemented.</span>

<span class="s0">image::</span><span class="s1">check_activityDiagram.png</span><span class="s0">[</span><span class="s1">width = &quot;800&quot;</span><span class="s0">]</span>

<span class="s0">=== Checklists</span>
<span class="s1">Checklist of each event can be used to remind users of certain items (e.g. bring glasses to concert).</span>
<span class="s1">This is implemented by storing an array list of strings in </span><span class="s0">`</span><span class="s4">Event</span><span class="s0">` </span><span class="s1">objects.</span>
<span class="s1">Storing checklist data to files will be available in v2.0.</span>

<span class="s1">Checklist implementation contains 4 operations:</span>

<span class="s0">==== add checklist item</span>
<span class="s0">`</span><span class="s4">checklist add </span><span class="s1">&lt;</span><span class="s4">event index</span><span class="s1">&gt;</span><span class="s4">/</span><span class="s1">&lt;</span><span class="s4">checklist item</span><span class="s1">&gt;</span><span class="s0">`</span>
<span class="s1">This adds an item into a specific event's checklist.</span>

<span class="s0">==== view checklist</span>
<span class="s0">`</span><span class="s4">checklist view </span><span class="s1">&lt;</span><span class="s4">event index</span><span class="s1">&gt;</span><span class="s0">`</span>
<span class="s1">This prints on the screen the checklist of an event.</span>

<span class="s0">==== edit checklist item</span>
<span class="s0">`</span><span class="s4">checklist edit </span><span class="s1">&lt;</span><span class="s4">event index</span><span class="s1">&gt; &lt;</span><span class="s4">item index</span><span class="s1">&gt;</span><span class="s4">/</span><span class="s1">&lt;</span><span class="s4">new item</span><span class="s1">&gt;</span><span class="s0">`</span>
<span class="s1">This edits a specific item in the checklist of an event.</span>

<span class="s0">==== delete checklist item</span>
<span class="s0">`</span><span class="s4">checklist delete </span><span class="s1">&lt;</span><span class="s4">event index</span><span class="s1">&gt; &lt;</span><span class="s4">item index</span><span class="s1">&gt;</span><span class="s0">`</span>
<span class="s1">This deletes an item from the checklist of an event.</span>

<span class="s0">=== Clash handling</span>
<span class="s0">==== Activity diagram</span>
<span class="s1">The following activity diagram represents a typical clash handling scenario</span>

<span class="s0">image::</span><span class="s1">Activity Diagram Clash handling.png</span><span class="s0">[</span><span class="s1">Clash Handling</span><span class="s0">, </span><span class="s1">1600</span><span class="s0">, </span><span class="s1">align=center</span><span class="s0">]</span>

<span class="s0">==== How is it implemented</span>
<span class="s1">The program is able to </span><span class="s0">*</span><span class="s1">detect clashes when creating new events</span><span class="s0">*</span><span class="s1">. When the user enters the command</span>
<span class="s1">to add a new Event entry to the list, the method </span><span class="s0">`</span><span class="s4">EventList.addEvent</span><span class="s0">` </span><span class="s1">is called from the </span><span class="s0">`</span><span class="s4">Command</span><span class="s0">`</span>
<span class="s1">class object upon execution.</span>

<span class="s1">The </span><span class="s0">`</span><span class="s4">addEvent</span><span class="s0">` </span><span class="s1">method will then call the </span><span class="s0">`</span><span class="s4">EventList.clashEvent</span><span class="s0">` </span><span class="s1">method to check the</span>
<span class="s1">existing entries for any clash in schedule. This is done by first searching the list for an event</span>
<span class="s1">that has a matching date with the new event.</span>

<span class="s1">If no such event is found, the method returns a </span><span class="s0">*_</span><span class="s1">null</span><span class="s0">_* </span><span class="s1">value, indicating that there is no schedule clash.</span>
<span class="s1">If an event is found with a matching date, the </span><span class="s0">`</span><span class="s4">clashEvent</span><span class="s0">` </span><span class="s1">then calls the </span><span class="s0">`</span><span class="s4">EventList.timeClash</span><span class="s0">` </span><span class="s1">method to check whether</span>
<span class="s1">the two events have overlapping time periods.</span>

<span class="s1">If there is any overlap, the </span><span class="s0">`</span><span class="s4">timeClash</span><span class="s0">` </span><span class="s1">method will return </span><span class="s0">*_</span><span class="s1">true</span><span class="s0">_* </span><span class="s1">as a boolean, indicating there is a schedule clash.</span>
<span class="s1">The </span><span class="s0">`</span><span class="s4">clashEvent</span><span class="s0">` </span><span class="s1">method then throws an exception </span><span class="s0">`</span><span class="s4">ClashException</span><span class="s0">`</span><span class="s1">, indicating that there was indeed a schedule</span>
<span class="s1">clash between the desired new entry and some pre-existing Event.</span>

<span class="s1">The details of the clashing Event are passed back to </span><span class="s0">`</span><span class="s4">Command</span><span class="s0">` </span><span class="s1">object via the exception so that it can be used to inform the</span>
<span class="s1">user about the clashing event. The user is then required to fix the conflict before continuing,</span>
<span class="s1">either by rescheduling or deleting the pre-existing event, or by choosing a different date/time for</span>
<span class="s1">the new Event entry.</span>

<span class="s0">==== Why it is implemented this way</span>
<span class="s1">The process of checking for a clash was implemented as small, simple components so as to ensure scalability,</span>
<span class="s1">reliability, and to reduce dependencies.</span>

<span class="s1">The choice to use exception handling to deal with an event clash</span>
<span class="s1">was done so that it could be easily re-purposed for any incremental extension that required checking for a</span>
<span class="s1">schedule clash. Catching of the ClashException should be performed in the Command class, and the info regarding the</span>
<span class="s1">schedule clash can be easily obtained for further action.</span>

<span class="s1">By having the </span><span class="s0">`</span><span class="s4">clashEvent</span><span class="s0">` </span><span class="s1">method return a </span><span class="s0">*_</span><span class="s1">null</span><span class="s0">_* </span><span class="s1">value or a reference to a clashing event in the schedule, the</span>
<span class="s0">`</span><span class="s4">clashEvent</span><span class="s0">` </span><span class="s1">method can now be used for any further increments to the code requiring addition of events.</span>

<span class="s1">It was thus easy to implement this clash detection as a part of adding recurrent events</span>
<span class="s1">(to check for clashes when recurrent events were automatically entered) as well as the</span>
<span class="s1">rescheduling function (to check for clashes when the user attempts to reschedule</span>
<span class="s1">an existing event, so that he/she does not inadvertently create a new schedule conflict).</span>

<span class="s1">This implementation is reliable because it can always be expected to work whenever it is necessary to add</span>
<span class="s1">new events to the list, provided the unit tests for this functionality under MainTest work. It is also not</span>
<span class="s1">dependent on any other functionality, allowing for developers to change the implementation of other parts of the</span>
<span class="s1">application without affecting the clash handling</span>

<span class="s0">==== Expected behaviour of functionality</span>
<span class="s1">When a user attempts to add an event(recurring or otherwise) and the program detects a clash with an existing event</span>
<span class="s1">in the pre-existing list, the following output should be printed: </span><span class="s0">+

    <span class="s1">&quot;That event clashes with another in the schedule! Please resolve the conflict and try again!&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">==== Design considerations</span>
<span class="s1">While designing the clash handling system, i had to decide how best to: </span><span class="s0">+ 
</span><span class="s1">1. Detect a clash. </span><span class="s0">+ 
</span><span class="s1">2. Pass relevant information back to the caller class for further usage. </span><span class="s0">+ 
</span>
<span class="s0">|=========================================================</span>
<span class="s1">|Aspect |Alternative 1 |Alternative 2</span>

<span class="s1">|How clashes were detected |</span>
<span class="s1">Simple if-else statements instead of using exception handling. </span><span class="s0">+ 
</span>
<span class="s1">Pros: Much easier to implement and simpler to work with. </span><span class="s0">+ 
</span>
<span class="s1">Cons: Less scalability as it would be harder to integrate the functionality into new features.|</span>
<span class="s1">Have a specific command/method so that the current list can be checked for a clash at will.</span>

<span class="s1">Pros: Much more flexible, and even more scalable than the current implementation as it would be possible</span>
<span class="s1">to do anything regarding changes to the list, and then later check for clashes.</span>

<span class="s1">Cons: Much more room for error, since clashes are allowed to exist within the list normally, and are not</span>
<span class="s1">automatically detected. This could lead to major bugs related to events that overlap each other.</span>

<span class="s1">|How relevant information is passed up the chain|</span>
<span class="s1">Simply returning the relevant event that caused the clash as a part of the method call. </span><span class="s0">+ 
</span>
<span class="s1">Pros: Extremely simple to understand. Easy to implement. No need to deal with exception handling, just</span>
<span class="s1">code for specific case in the event of a clash. </span><span class="s0">+ 
</span>
<span class="s1">Cons: Less scalable. If a developer wants to add more functionality to the clash handling(e.g return more data), he/she</span>
<span class="s1">would need to return a new object containing the relevant data.|</span>

<span class="s0">==== How it is implemented</span>
<span class="s1">The program is able to detect recurring events and their periods when creating new events.</span>
<span class="s1">When the user enters the command to add a new </span><span class="s0">`</span><span class="s4">Lesson</span><span class="s0">` </span><span class="s1">or </span><span class="s0">`</span><span class="s4">Practice</span><span class="s0">` </span><span class="s1">event with a period (in days) followed,</span>

</span><span class="s1">If the new event is not a recurring event, the period value will be assigned to </span><span class="s0">`</span><span class="s4">NON-PERIOD</span><span class="s0">` </span><span class="s1">and then call the</span>
<span class="s0">`</span><span class="s4">addEvent</span><span class="s0">` </span><span class="s1">method in the </span><span class="s0">`</span><span class="s4">EventList</span><span class="s0">` </span><span class="s1">class.</span>

<span class="s1">maximum date between the first recurring event and the last one is up to </span><span class="s0">`</span><span class="s4">ONE_SEMESTER_DAYS</span><span class="s0">` </span><span class="s1">which is assigned to</span>

<span class="s1">All the events created in the </span><span class="s0">`</span><span class="s4">addRecurringEvent</span><span class="s0">` </span><span class="s1">method will be checked whether having clash with the events in the</span>
<span class="s1">current eventList and then added in a temporary event list one by one. If no clash happens, the </span><span class="s0">`</span><span class="s4">tempEventList</span><span class="s0">` </span><span class="s1">will</span>
<span class="s1">be added to the current </span><span class="s0">`</span><span class="s4">eventList</span><span class="s0">`</span><span class="s1">.</span>

<span class="s1">Given below is an example usage scenario compared to adding non-recurring event. </span><span class="s0">+ 
</span><span class="s1">Recurring event: </span><span class="s0">`</span><span class="s4">lesson|practice</span><span class="s0">` </span><span class="s1">&lt;event description&gt; /dd-MM-yyyy HHmm HHmm </span><span class="s0">`</span><span class="s4">/</span><span class="s1">&lt;</span><span class="s4">period</span><span class="s1">(</span><span class="s4">in days</span><span class="s1">)&gt;</span><span class="s0">` + 
</span><span class="s1">Non-recurring event: &lt;event type&gt; &lt;event description&gt; /dd-MM-yyyy HHmm HHmm</span>

<span class="s0">==== Why it is implemented this way</span>
<span class="s0">. </span><span class="s1">Whether the input command has a period is considered at the first, so that the dependency between adding</span>
<span class="s1">recurrent events and adding normal events could be reduced.</span>
<span class="s0">. </span><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s0">`</span><span class="s4">add</span><span class="s1">(</span><span class="s4">int field, int amount</span><span class="s1">)</span><span class="s0">` </span><span class="s1">method of </span><span class="s0">`</span><span class="s4">Calendar</span><span class="s0">` </span><span class="s1">class is used to add or subtract from the given calendar field</span>
<span class="s1">and a specific amount of time, based on the calendar's rules. </span><span class="s0">+

<span class="s0">. </span><span class="s1">Since the number of recurrent events with a short period could be large, it is more likely to have clashes with the</span>
<span class="s1">current eventList. Hence, before added in the temporary event list, the new event need to be ensured that no clash</span>
<span class="s1">happens.</span>
<span class="s0">. </span><span class="s1">To keep the format of creating new events, the format process of changing Java Date to String is done in the</span>
<span class="s0">`</span><span class="s4">EventDate</span><span class="s0">` </span><span class="s1">class instead of messing the </span><span class="s0">`</span><span class="s4">Event</span><span class="s0">` </span><span class="s1">class to accept both Date and String types as input date and time.</span>

<span class="s0">==== Sequence diagram</span>
<span class="s1">The following sequence diagram shows how the adding recurring event operation works.</span>

<span class="s0">==== Design considerations</span>
<span class="s1">Aspect: How to avoid adding infinite events </span><span class="s0">+ 
</span>
<span class="s0">* *</span><span class="s1">Alternative 1 (current choice):</span><span class="s0">* </span><span class="s1">Set a upper limit to ensure the interval between the first and last events added to</span>
<span class="s1">list is not too long.</span>
<span class="s0">** </span><span class="s1">Pros: Easy to implement. Easy to add lesson and practice in one semester.</span>
<span class="s0">** </span><span class="s1">Cons: Not agility. May add too many extra events if users want short interval between the first and last</span>
<span class="s1">recurring events.</span>
<span class="s0">* *</span><span class="s1">Alternative 2:</span><span class="s0">* </span><span class="s1">Let users to set the interval between the first and last recurring events.</span>
<span class="s0">** </span><span class="s1">Pros: Will be more agility and user friendly.</span>
<span class="s0">** </span><span class="s1">Cons: Hard to unify the command format.</span>

<span class="s0">=== Contacts list</span>
<span class="s0">==== How is it implemented</span>
<span class="s1">The contacts list stores a list of contacts contain &lt;name&gt;, &lt;email address&gt;, and &lt;phone number&gt; information added by</span>
<span class="s1">users. The list is stored in each individual event. When the user first creates the event, the event is created with an</span>
<span class="s1">empty contact list. </span><span class="s0">+ 
*</span><span class="s1">Users can add, edit, delete a specified contact item, and view the contacts list of a specified event.</span><span class="s0">*</span>

<span class="s0">===== Adding a contact</span>
<span class="s0">====</span>
<span class="s1">Given below is an example to adding a contact: </span><span class="s0">+ 
`</span><span class="s4">contact add </span><span class="s1">&lt;</span><span class="s4">event number</span><span class="s1">&gt; </span><span class="s4">/</span><span class="s1">&lt;</span><span class="s4">name</span><span class="s1">&gt;</span><span class="s4">, </span><span class="s1">&lt;</span><span class="s4">email address</span><span class="s1">&gt;</span><span class="s4">, </span><span class="s1">&lt;</span><span class="s4">phone number</span><span class="s1">&gt;</span><span class="s0">`</span>
<span class="s0">====</span>
<span class="s0">.. </span><span class="s1">When the command is entered, the manageContacts() method will be called.</span>
<span class="s0">.. </span><span class="s1">The method will check whether the event ID is valid. Add a new Contact will be created with contact information in it.</span>
<span class="s0">.. </span><span class="s1">The event corresponding to the ID entered along with its method addContact() will be called to add the contact into</span>
<span class="s1">the contact list in the event.</span>
<span class="s0">.. </span><span class="s1">The printContactAdded() method of the UI class will be called to reflect the change to the user.</span>

<span class="s0">===== Viewing the contact list</span>
<span class="s0">====</span>
<span class="s1">Given below is an example to view contact list of an event: </span><span class="s0">+ 
`</span><span class="s4">contact view </span><span class="s1">&lt;</span><span class="s4">event number</span><span class="s1">&gt;</span><span class="s0">`</span>
<span class="s0">====</span>
<span class="s0">.. </span><span class="s1">When the command is entered, the manageContacts() method will be called.</span>
<span class="s0">.. </span><span class="s1">The method will check whether the event ID is valid, and whether the contact list of the event is empty.</span>
<span class="s0">.. </span><span class="s1">If the contact list is empty, printNoContactInEvent() will be called to inform the user that contact list is empty.</span>
<span class="s1">If the contact list is not empty, printEventContacts() will be called ang print all the contacts in the list under the event.</span>

<span class="s0">===== Editing a contact</span>
<span class="s0">====</span>
<span class="s1">Given below is an example to edit a contact in the contact list: </span><span class="s0">+ 
`</span><span class="s4">contact edit </span><span class="s1">&lt;</span><span class="s4">event number</span><span class="s1">&gt; &lt;</span><span class="s4">contact number</span><span class="s1">&gt; </span><span class="s4">name|email|phone /</span><span class="s1">&lt;</span><span class="s4">new contact</span><span class="s1">&gt;</span><span class="s0">`</span>
<span class="s0">====</span>
<span class="s0">.. </span><span class="s1">When the command is entered, the manageContacts() method will be called.</span>
<span class="s0">.. </span><span class="s1">The method will check whether the event ID, the contact ID, and the edit type are valid.</span>
<span class="s0">.. </span><span class="s1">The contact information will be changed.</span>
<span class="s0">.. </span><span class="s1">The printContactEdited() method of the UI class will be called to reflect the change to the user.</span>

<span class="s0">===== Deleting a contact</span>
<span class="s0">====</span>
<span class="s1">Given below is an example to delete a contact in the contact list: </span><span class="s0">+ 
`</span><span class="s4">contact delete </span><span class="s1">&lt;</span><span class="s4">event number</span><span class="s1">&gt; &lt;</span><span class="s4">contact number</span><span class="s1">&gt;</span><span class="s0">`</span>
<span class="s0">====</span>
<span class="s0">.. </span><span class="s1">When the command is entered, the manageContacts() method will be called.</span>
<span class="s0">.. </span><span class="s1">The method will check whether the event ID and the contact ID are valid.</span>
<span class="s0">.. </span><span class="s1">The contact will be deleted from the list.</span>
<span class="s0">.. </span><span class="s1">The printContactDeleted() method of the UI class will be called to reflect the change to the user.</span>

<span class="s0">==== Why is it implemented this way</span>
<span class="s0">. </span><span class="s1">For different events, users may have different people to contact with. So a empty contact list is created under each</span>
<span class="s1">event. For some events, users may have more than one person to contact with. Hence, users are allowed add more contact</span>
<span class="s1">items under one event.</span>
<span class="s0">. </span><span class="s1">We want to keep the information highly relative to contact, so users just need to add &lt;name&gt;, &lt;email address&gt;, and</span>
<span class="s1">&lt;phone number&gt; for a contact item. Sometimes may not have the email or phone number of a person, so it also allows users</span>
<span class="s1">to add one of &lt;email address&gt; and &lt;phone number&gt;.</span>
<span class="s0">. </span><span class="s1">The main propose of MisterMusik is schedule events, so the contact list is hidden on the basic list viewing. Users can</span>
<span class="s1">use command </span><span class="s0">`</span><span class="s4">contact view </span><span class="s1">&lt;</span><span class="s4">event number</span><span class="s1">&gt;</span><span class="s0">` </span><span class="s1">to see the contact list of the specified event.</span>

<span class="s0">=== Viewing specific dates</span>
<span class="s0">==== How is it implemented</span>
<span class="s1">The implementation is a simple for loop that runs through the existing task list. If a matching date is detected,</span>
<span class="s1">it will return the corresponding task and add it to a temporary list of found tasks. After running through the whole</span>
<span class="s1">list, the temporary list will be printed out to display all the tasks of a specific date.</span>

<span class="s1">Step 1: When the command &quot;view &lt;date&gt;&quot; is given, the viewEvents() method will be called.</span>

<span class="s1">Step 2: A temporary ArrayList is created by the method to be populated.</span>

<span class="s1">Step 3: The date string from the input command is passed into the EventDate class to be formatted into the same format as that of</span>
<span class="s1">each event and returned as a string.</span>

<span class="s1">Step 4: The returned string is compared with each task in the event list to check for any event with a matching date.</span>

<span class="s1">Step 5: When an event with a matching date is found, the event is added to the temporary list.</span>

<span class="s1">Step 6: After the entire list has been checked, the temporary list is passed into a UI instance</span>

<span class="s1">Step 7: The printFoundEvents() method will be called. The said method then prints out the temporary list, displaying the list of events taking place on a specific date.</span>

<span class="s1">In the situation when an empty temporary list is passed into the UI for it to print, an exception will occur and the</span>
<span class="s1">printFoundEvents() method will catch the exception before printing out a string to inform the user that there are no tasks</span>
<span class="s1">taking place on that specific date.</span>

<span class="s0">==== Activity Diagram</span>
<span class="s0">image::</span><span class="s1">DGViewEventsDiagram.png</span><span class="s0">[]</span>

<span class="s0">==== Why is it implemented this way</span>
<span class="s1">The matching events are being stored individually into a separate temporary list before being printed out. This is to allow</span>
<span class="s1">an easier handling of individual tasks as separate instances in case the user wishes to edit a particular task from the</span>
<span class="s1">temporary list.</span>

<span class="s0">==== Alternative implementations considered</span>
<span class="s1">Storing all the matching events as a single string, passing the string into the printFoundEvents() method to print out. This</span>
<span class="s1">implementation is undesirable as it will be difficult to access individual matching events in the case the user wishes to edit</span>
<span class="s1">them as mentioned above.</span>

<span class="s0">image::</span><span class="s1">ViewScheduleSeqDiagram.png</span><span class="s0">[]</span>

<span class="s0">=== Goals List</span>
<span class="s0">==== How is it implemented</span>
<span class="s1">The goals list is an array list type that stores a list of goals to be achieved by the user for each individual event, particularly</span>
<span class="s1">for Lesson and Practice type events. When the user first creates the event, the event is created with an empty goal list. Only</span>
<span class="s1">when the user types in &quot;goal add &lt;event ID&gt;&quot; then the goal list will be updated with the particular goal. The user can then</span>
<span class="s1">manipulate the goal list by using &quot;goal edit&quot;, &quot;goal delete&quot; or &quot;goal view&quot; commands.</span>

<span class="s0">===== Adding a goal</span>
<span class="s1">Step 1: When the command &quot;goal add &lt;event ID&gt;/&lt;goal description&gt;&quot; is entered, the goalsManagement() method will be called.</span>

<span class="s1">Step 2: The command description will be split up into separate strings. The string for event ID will be parsed into an</span>
<span class="s1">integer type.</span>

<span class="s1">Step 3: The method will check the string for the goal command description. In this case it will be &quot;add&quot; and execute the</span>
<span class="s1">code for this case.</span>

<span class="s1">Step 4: A new Goal class instance will be created with the goal description string. Its achieved status set as false.</span>

<span class="s1">Step 5: The event corresponding to the ID entered along with its method addGoal() will be called to add the goal instance</span>
<span class="s1">into the goal list.</span>

<span class="s1">Step 6: The goalAdded() method of the UI class will be called to reflect the change to the user.</span>

<span class="s0">===== Editing a goal</span>
<span class="s1">Step 1: The user will enter the command &quot;goal edit &lt;event ID&gt; &lt;goal ID&gt;/&lt;new goal description&gt;&quot;. The goalsManagement() method</span>
<span class="s1">is called.</span>

<span class="s1">Step 2: The command description will be split up into separate strings. The strings for event ID and goal ID will be parsed</span>
<span class="s1">into an integer type.</span>

<span class="s1">Step 3: The method will check the string for the goal command description. In this case it will be &quot;edit&quot; and execute the</span>
<span class="s1">code for this case.</span>

<span class="s1">Step 4: A new Goal class instance will be created for the new goal description.</span>

<span class="s1">Step 5: The method editGoalList() of the event corresponding to the input ID will be called. The method will set the goal indicated</span>
<span class="s1">as the new Goal instance.</span>

<span class="s1">Step 6: The goalUpdated() method of the UI class will be called to reflect the change to the user.</span>

<span class="s0">===== Deleting a goal</span>
<span class="s1">Step 1: When the user enters the command &quot;goal delete &lt;event ID&gt; &lt;goal ID&gt;&quot;, the goalsManagement() method will be called.</span>

<span class="s1">Step 2: The command description will be split up into separate strings. The strings for event ID and goal ID will be parsed</span>
<span class="s1">into an integer type.</span>

<span class="s1">Step 3: The method will check the string for the goal command description. In this case it will be &quot;delete&quot; and execute the</span>
<span class="s1">code for this case.</span>

<span class="s1">Step 4: The corresponding event will have its removeGoal() method called which removes the indicated goal from the list.</span>

<span class="s1">Step 5: The goalDeleted() method of the UI class will be called to reflect the change to the user.</span>

<span class="s0">===== Setting the goal as achieved</span>
<span class="s1">Step 1: When the command &quot;goal achieved &lt;event ID&gt; &lt;goal ID&gt;&quot; is given, the goalsManagement() method will be called.</span>

<span class="s1">Step 2: The command description will be split up into separate strings. The strings for event ID and goal ID will be parsed</span>
<span class="s1">into an integer type.</span>

<span class="s1">Step 3: The method will check the string for the goal command description. In this case it will be &quot;achieved&quot; and execute the</span>
<span class="s1">code for this case.</span>

<span class="s1">Step 4: The method updateGoalAchieved() for the corresponding event will be called.</span>

<span class="s1">Step 5: The goals list within the event is called with the indicated goal.</span>

<span class="s1">Step 6: The indicated goal will then call its setAchieved() method that assigns the boolean isAchieved attribute of that</span>
<span class="s1">particular goal to &quot;true&quot;.</span>

<span class="s1">Step 7: The goalSetAsAchieved() method of the UI class will be called to reflect the change to the user.</span>

<span class="s0">===== Viewing the goal list</span>
<span class="s1">Step 1: The user will enter the command &quot;goal view &lt;event ID&gt;&quot;. The goalsManagement() method will be called.</span>

<span class="s1">Step 2: Command description will be split and the string for event ID will be parsed into an integer type.</span>

<span class="s1">Step 3: The printEventGoals() method will be called to check the contents of the goal list for the indicated event.</span>

<span class="s1">Step 4: If the goals list is not empty, it will print out the contents of the list using a for loop. Otherwise it will</span>
<span class="s1">print a message to the user to reflect that the goal list is empty.</span>

<span class="s0">==== Why is it implemented this way</span>
<span class="s1">The goal managing function is implemented as a separate list within an event in order to utilise the indexing of the list</span>
<span class="s1">elements. This way, a particular goal for a particular event can be easily accessed and manipulated via the input of an</span>
<span class="s1">integer.</span>

<span class="s0">==== Alternatives considered</span>
<span class="s1">An alternate method considered was to implement the goals list as a separate class of its own. Each goal within this list</span>
<span class="s1">will then be mapped to their corresponding events. This implementation method would cause difficulties on the users' part</span>
<span class="s1">in identifying the ID of a particular goal and would generally makes the goal list less organised.</span>

<span class="s0">==== Sequence Diagram</span>
<span class="s1">Below is a sequence diagram for the &quot;goal delete&quot; operation.</span>
<span class="s0">image:</span><span class="s1">DeleteGoalSeq.png</span><span class="s0">[]</span>

<span class="s0">=== Past event management</span>
<span class="s1">This functionality basically tracks which tasks in the list have already passed, and subsequently only displays future</span>
<span class="s1">tasks when the user uses the &quot;list&quot; command to view the list. This function is linked with the goals management function</span>
<span class="s1">as it also detects unachieved goals in events that are already over.</span>

<span class="s0">==== How is it implemented</span>
<span class="s1">The EventList class contains an integer attribute called currentDateIndex, which will be initialised to 0. The system will</span>
<span class="s1">then compare the current date with the start dates of each of the events in the event list. Once an event that is in the</span>
<span class="s1">future has been reached, the index of the event will be assigned to the currentDateIndex. After this has been done, the</span>
<span class="s1">&quot;list&quot; command will only list out events starting from that particular index.</span>

<span class="s1">Step 1: The integer attribute currentDateIndex in the EventList class instance will be initialised to 0 and the Date class</span>
<span class="s1">currentDate attribute will be initialised to the system date and time of that instance</span>

<span class="s1">Step 2: Whenever the user inputs the &quot;list&quot; command, the listOfEvents_String() method is called which will in turn call the</span>
<span class="s1">findNextEventAndSetBoolean() method which takes in the Date class that has been initialised in step 1.</span>

<span class="s1">Step 3: In the findNextEventAndSetBoolean() method, the start dates of each event are compared to the current date using</span>
<span class="s1">Date class's compareTo() method using a for loop.</span>

<span class="s1">Step 4: The moment the loop reaches an event that has not happened yet i.e. its start date is later than the current date,</span>
<span class="s1">the index of the event in the list will be assigned to the currentDateIndex and the loop terminates.</span>

<span class="s1">Step 5: Back in the listOfEvents_String() method, the list of events starting from the one with the same index integer as</span>
<span class="s1">currentDateIndex will be returned to the UI class to be printed out.</span>

<span class="s0">==== Why is it implemented this way</span>
<span class="s1">This function is implemented this way to maximise the usefulness of the indexing nature of ArrayList. Even if an</span>
<span class="s1">event has passed and the list no longer shows it, the indexes of all the events are kept constant. This is crucial as the</span>
<span class="s1">commands for most of our functions require the user to indicate the index of an event they want to manipulate, and keeping</span>
<span class="s1">them constant makes it very easy for the user to input commands without having to take note of the change in the event indexes</span>
<span class="s1">after making any changes to the list.</span>

<span class="s0">==== Alternatives considered</span>
<span class="s1">We have considered the possibility of deleting the past events that are over. However, as mentioned above we require the indexing</span>
<span class="s1">of the events to stay constant and by deleting the past events, the event indexes will change as well.</span>

<span class="s0">==== Integration with goal list management</span>
<span class="s0">===== Implementation</span>
<span class="s1">The management of goals list can be integrated with the ability to track past events. This is done through a boolean attribute</span>
<span class="s1">gotPastUnachieved in the EventList class. If true, there are unachieved goals for past events and vice versa.</span>

<span class="s1">Step 1: User enters the &quot;list&quot; command. The listOfEvents_String() method is called which then calls the findNextEventAndSetBoolean() method.</span>

<span class="s1">Step 1: Within the findNextEventAndSetBoolean() method, the attribute currentDateIndex is checked to see if it is more than 0. If it</span>
<span class="s1">is, that means there are past events.</span>

<span class="s1">Step 2: If there are past events, the method will enter a nest of two for loops. The outer loop runs through all the past events,</span>
<span class="s1">while the inner loop iterates through the goal list for each individual past event.</span>

<span class="s1">Step 3: Each time an inner loop is iterated through, the getBooleanStatus() method for the particular event will be called. If returns</span>
<span class="s1">true, gotPastUnachieved will be assigned as true and the method will break out of the loop.</span>

<span class="s1">Step 4: After the event list has been printed out, the method getPastEventsWithUnachievedGoals() is called. This method utilises two</span>
<span class="s1">nested for loops to identify the unachieved goals among all the past events and passes both the past events along with all their</span>
<span class="s1">unachieved goals to the UI class to be printed out below the event list.</span>

<span class="s0">==== Sequence Diagram</span>
<span class="s0">image::</span><span class="s1">PastEventAndGoalsListManagementSeq.png</span><span class="s0">[]</span>

<span class="s0">=== Reminders</span>

<span class="s0">==== How it is implemented</span>
<span class="s1">The reminder function filters out the tasks that are due or are happening before 2359 an input number of days after </span>
<span class="s1">the current date, and prints them out as a reminder for the users. If the number of days is not provided, the number</span>
<span class="s1">of days is 3 by default.</span>

<span class="s1">After the user enters 'reminder', the Command.execute method calls Command.remindEvents, which in turn calls the</span>
<span class="s1">Ui.printReminders function. The Ui.printReminders function calls the EventList.getReminder method, which uses the</span>
<span class="s1">EventList.filteredList method to filter out a list of events that are due or are happening before 2359 the input number </span>
<span class="s1">of days after the current date. The EventList.filteredListTwoPredicates method filters out events from the stored list of </span>
<span class="s1">events according to two input predicates.</span>

<span class="s1">The constructor of the Predicate class takes in two arguments: the reference and the comparator. The reference is the</span>
<span class="s1">item that is used for the comparison reference (comp) input, and the comparator is the operator that is used for the</span>
<span class="s1">comparison. The comparator should be either one of the three global integer variables: EQUAL, GREATER_THAN or SMALLER_THAN.</span>
<span class="s1">The Predicate.check method takes in an input and checks if reference (comp) input is true by calling the appropriate method</span>
<span class="s1">in the Predicate class depending on the type of the reference and input.</span>

<span class="s1">In the EventList.getReminder method, the reference of the one of the two input Predicate objects is an eventDate object set to</span>
<span class="s1">2359 the input number of days after the current date, and the comparator is GREATER_THAN. The reference of the other</span>
<span class="s1">input Predicate object is an eventDate object set to the current time. After that, the EventList.getReminder </span>
<span class="s1">method calls the EventList.filteredListTwoPredicates method. In the EventList.filteredListTwoPredicates method, the system </span>
<span class="s1">iterates through the list of Events in </span><span class="s0">`</span><span class="s4">eventArrayList</span><span class="s0">`</span><span class="s1">.The EventDate object stored in the Event object is passed into the</span>
<span class="s1">Predicate.check method. If the EventDate object stored in the Event object is a date before the reference date, the Predicate.check</span>
<span class="s1">method returns true and the Event object is added to the output. After all the elements in EventList.filteredListTwoPredicates are</span>
<span class="s1">parsed and the EventList.filteredListTwoPredicates method terminates, EventList.getReminder method returns a string containing the</span>
<span class="s1">current date and time, the date and time at 2359 the input number of days after the current date, and the filtered list of events. </span>
<span class="s1">This string is printed to stdout in the Ui.printReminders function.</span>

<span class="s0">==== Sequence diagram</span>
<span class="s1">The following sequence diagram shows how the reminder functionality works.</span>
<span class="s0">====</span>
<span class="s0">image::</span><span class="s1">reminderSequenceDiagram.png</span><span class="s0">[</span><span class="s1">width = 100%</span><span class="s0">]</span>
<span class="s0">====</span>

<span class="s0">==== Why it is implemented this way</span>
<span class="s1">The reminder function is split the various components into different methods for easier testing. In this case, Ui.printReminders</span>
<span class="s1">prints the output to the user interface, EventList.getReminder is responsible for compiling the output whereas EventList.filteredList</span>
<span class="s1">obtains the filtered list of events from </span><span class="s0">`</span><span class="s4">eventArrayList</span><span class="s0">`</span><span class="s1">.</span>

<span class="s1">This implementation also implements scalability as the Predicate class and the EventList.filteredList method can be reused for other</span>
<span class="s1">functions.</span>

<span class="s0">=== Instruments</span>

<span class="s0">==== How it is implemented</span>
<span class="s1">The mistermusik.commons.Instruments.InstrumentList class stores an array list of instruments. Instruments are objects of class</span>
<span class="s1">mistermusic.commons.Instruments.Instrument. Each instance of the mistermusic.commons.Instruments.Instrument class also has an </span>
<span class="s1">array list of services. Services are objects of class mistermusic.commons.Instruments.Services.</span>

<span class="s0">==== Adding an instrument</span>

<span class="s1">Step 1: The user will type in the command </span><span class="s0">`</span><span class="s4">instrument add /</span><span class="s1">&lt;</span><span class="s4">instrument name</span><span class="s1">&gt;</span><span class="s0">`</span><span class="s1">. The addInstrument() method from the InstrumentList </span>
<span class="s1">class is called.</span>

<span class="s1">Step 2: The addInstrument() method creates a new instance of Instrument with the given input name. </span>

<span class="s1">Step 3: The getInstrumentIndexAndName() method, which returns a string containing the index of the instrument and the name, is </span>
<span class="s1">called. </span>

<span class="s1">Step 4: The instrumentAdded() method from the Ui class is then called, which prints a message stating that the instrument has</span>
<span class="s1">been added.</span>

<span class="s0">==== Viewing the list of instruments stored in the system</span>

<span class="s1">Step 1: The user will type in the command </span><span class="s0">`</span><span class="s4">instrument view instruments</span><span class="s0">`</span><span class="s1">. The getInstruments() method from the InstrumentList </span>
<span class="s1">class is called.</span>

<span class="s1">Step 2: The getInstruments() method returns a string containing a list of instruments stored in the InstrumentList instance used</span>
<span class="s1">for the program. </span>

<span class="s1">Step 3: The printInstruments() method from the Ui class is then called, which prints out the list of instruments stored in the</span>
<span class="s1">InstrumentList instance used for the program.</span>

<span class="s0">==== Servicing an instrument</span>

<span class="s1">Step 1: The user will type in the command </span><span class="s0">`</span><span class="s4">instrument service </span><span class="s1">&lt;</span><span class="s4">instrument index</span><span class="s1">&gt; </span><span class="s4">/</span><span class="s1">&lt;</span><span class="s4">brief description of servicing</span><span class="s1">&gt; </span><span class="s4">/</span><span class="s1">&lt;</span><span class="s4">date</span><span class="s1">&gt;</span><span class="s0">`</span><span class="s1">.</span>
<span class="s1">The service() method from the InstrumentList instance is called.</span>

<span class="s1">Step 2: The service() method of the InstrumentList instance calls the addService() method of the referenced Instrument stored in the</span>
<span class="s1">InstrumentList instance based on the input index. </span>

<span class="s1">Step 3: The addService() method adds the relevant servicing information to the Instrument instance by creating a new ServiceInfo</span>
<span class="s1">instance and adding it to the array list of ServiceInfo stored in the Instrument instance, and returns the number of ServiceInfo</span>
<span class="s1">instances stored in the array list.</span>

<span class="s1">Step 4: The getInstrumentIndexAndName() method of the InstrumentList instance, which returns a string containing the index of </span>
<span class="s1">the instrument and the name, is called. </span>

<span class="s1">Step 5: The getIndexAndService() method of the InstrumentList instance is called, which in turn calls the getIndexAndService()</span>
<span class="s1">method of the relevant Instrument instance stored in the InstrumentList instance used for the program. Both methods return the </span>
<span class="s1">index of the required servicing and the brief description of the servicing. The getIndexAndService() method of the Instrument</span>
<span class="s1">instance calls the getServiceInfo() method on the relevant service to obtain the brief description of the servicing. </span>

<span class="s1">Step 6: The serviceAdded() method of the Ui class, which prints a message notifying the user that the servicing information has</span>
<span class="s1">been added, is then called.</span>

<span class="s0">==== Viewing the list of servicing done for a particular instrument</span>

<span class="s1">Step 1: The user will type in the command </span><span class="s0">`</span><span class="s4">instrument view services </span><span class="s1">&lt;</span><span class="s4">instrument index</span><span class="s1">&gt;</span><span class="s0">`</span><span class="s1">. The getInstrumentServiceInfo() method from </span>
<span class="s1">the InstrumentList class is called, which in turn calls the getServiceInfos() method of the relevant Instrument instance stored in </span>
<span class="s1">the array list of Instruments in the InstrumentList instance. Both methods return the list of servicing done to the relevant</span>
<span class="s1">instrument. The getServiceInfos() function iterates through the stored list of ServiceInfo instances and calls getServiceInfo() on</span>
<span class="s1">all the ServieInfo instances to obtain the descriptions of the servicings.</span>

<span class="s1">Step 2: The getInstrumentIndexAndName() method of the InstrumentList instance, which returns a string containing the index of </span>
<span class="s1">the instrument and the name, is called. </span>

<span class="s1">Step 3: The printServices() method from the Ui class is then called, which prints out the list of servicing stored in a particular</span>
<span class="s1">Instrument instance.</span>

<span class="s0">==== Sequence diagram</span>
<span class="s1">The following sequence diagram shows how the view services functionality works.</span>

<span class="s0">====</span>

<span class="s0">==== Why it is implemented this way</span>
<span class="s1">The implementation makes use of three classes, which are InstrumentList, Instrument and ServiceInfo. This allows for easier </span>
<span class="s1">testing as each of the classes represent a different component of the functionality. The InstrumentList instance stores an array </span>
<span class="s1">list of Instrument instances, an Instrument instance stores an array list of ServiceInfo instances.</span>


<span class="s0">== Documentation</span>
<span class="s1">We use asciidoc for writing documentation.</span>
<span class="s0">[</span><span class="s1">NOTE</span><span class="s0">]</span>
<span class="s1">We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility</span>
<span class="s1">in formatting.</span>

<span class="s0">== Testing</span>
<span class="s1">The testing for our application is done through Junit tests (also viable to run these through gradle) and</span>
<span class="s1">manual testing, covered in </span><span class="s0">&lt;&lt;Instructions for Manual Testing, </span><span class="s1">Appendix E: Instructions for manual testing</span><span class="s0">&gt;&gt;</span>

<span class="s0">=== Junit testing</span>
<span class="s0">. </span><span class="s1">IntelliJ: Simply right click the src/test/java directory and select </span><span class="s0">`</span><span class="s4">Run </span><span class="s1">'</span><span class="s4">Tests in </span><span class="s1">'</span><span class="s4">seedu.duke...</span><span class="s1">'</span><span class="s0">` </span><span class="s1">or right</span>
<span class="s1">click the individual test class you wish to run, and select </span><span class="s0">`</span><span class="s4">Run </span><span class="s1">'</span><span class="s4">BudgetTest</span><span class="s1">'</span><span class="s0">` </span><span class="s1">for example when testing</span>
<span class="s1">individual components. This can also be done through the Gradle sidebar (double click the corresponding test</span>
<span class="s1">under </span><span class="s0">`</span><span class="s4">run configurations</span><span class="s0">`</span><span class="s1">).</span>
<span class="s0">. </span><span class="s1">Command prompt: Simply type the command </span><span class="s0">`</span><span class="s4">gradlew clean test</span><span class="s0">`</span>

<span class="s0">== Dev Ops</span>
<span class="s1">For build automation, we chose to use gradle, allowing for a more convenient process when running tests and</span>
<span class="s1">checking for coding standard violations. Here are some of the gradle tasks that are essential to the</span>
<span class="s1">development of the application.</span>

<span class="s0">NOTE: </span><span class="s1">For all the following commands, it is possible to run them through the IntelliJ IDE using the gradle</span>
<span class="s1">task bar. The tasks on the task bar are identical in name to the command line tasks, so the following</span>
<span class="s1">information is still relevant regarding their functions.</span>

<span class="s0">=== How to run gradle commands</span>
<span class="s1">Use the command </span><span class="s0">`</span><span class="s4">gradlew </span><span class="s1">&lt;</span><span class="s4">taskname</span><span class="s1">&gt;</span><span class="s0">`</span>

<span class="s0">NOTE: </span><span class="s1">Different tasks can be run at the same time by using a format such as</span>
<span class="s0">`</span><span class="s4">gradlew </span><span class="s1">&lt;</span><span class="s4">task1</span><span class="s1">&gt; &lt;</span><span class="s4">task2</span><span class="s1">&gt;</span><span class="s4">...</span><span class="s0">`</span>

<span class="s0">WARNING: </span><span class="s1">For Mac users, you will need to add a </span><span class="s0">`</span><span class="s4">./</span><span class="s0">` </span><span class="s1">prefix before the command. For example,</span>
<span class="s0">`</span><span class="s4">./gradlew run</span><span class="s0">`</span>

<span class="s0">=== Building a jar file</span>
<span class="s1">The command </span><span class="s0">`</span><span class="s4">shadowJar</span><span class="s0">` </span><span class="s1">will build a jar file using the current source code and store it under</span>
<span class="s1">the #build/libs# directory.</span>

<span class="s0">=== Clean</span>
<span class="s1">The command </span><span class="s0">`</span><span class="s4">gradlew clean</span><span class="s0">` </span><span class="s1">will remove the buildDir folder, thus removing everything including leftover</span>
<span class="s1">files from previous builds which are no longer necessary.</span>

<span class="s0">WARNING: </span><span class="s1">While running a task, Gradle checks if it is actually necessary to carry out the procedure by default.</span>
<span class="s1">For example, Gradle will not rebuild the jar file if source code has not changed since the last time a jar file</span>
<span class="s1">was packaged.</span>

<span class="s1">In order to force gradle to execute the task, the </span><span class="s0">`</span><span class="s4">clean</span><span class="s0">` </span><span class="s1">command can be used. For instance,</span>
<span class="s0">`</span><span class="s4">gradlew clean shadowJar</span><span class="s0">` </span><span class="s1">will force a new jar file to be built.</span>

<span class="s0">=== Running the application</span>

<span class="s0">==== Run as per normal:</span>
<span class="s1">The command </span><span class="s0">`</span><span class="s4">gradlew run</span><span class="s0">` </span><span class="s1">will build and run the application</span>

<span class="s0">==== Run as jar file:</span>
<span class="s1">The command </span><span class="s0">`</span><span class="s4">gradlew runShadow</span><span class="s0">` </span><span class="s1">will build the project as a jar file, and then run it.</span>

<span class="s0">=== Checkstyle</span>
<span class="s1">Using the command </span><span class="s0">`</span><span class="s4">checkstyleMain</span><span class="s0">` </span><span class="s1">will check for style violations in the </span><span class="s0">*</span><span class="s1">main</span><span class="s0">* </span><span class="s1">source code.</span>
<span class="s1">Using the command </span><span class="s0">`</span><span class="s4">checkstyleTest</span><span class="s0">` </span><span class="s1">will check for style violations in the </span><span class="s0">*</span><span class="s1">test</span><span class="s0">* </span><span class="s1">source code.</span>

<span class="s0">NOTE: </span><span class="s1">The checkstyle settings can be configured by editing the </span><span class="s0">`</span><span class="s4">config/checkstyle/checkstyle.xml</span><span class="s0">`</span>
