<span class="s0">== Additional Features</span>

<span class="s0">=== Detecting Clashes :</span>

<span class="s1">When the user inputs a new event, MisterMusik will check</span>
<span class="s1">if it has any clashing date and time with existing events</span>
<span class="s1">and warns the user of the clash. This also detects clashes</span>
<span class="s1">when recurring events are entered, so there is no need</span>
<span class="s1">to manually check for schedule clashes.</span>

<span class="s0">=== Sorting By Date :</span>

<span class="s1">MisterMusik will automatically sort the list by the date and time of each task</span>
<span class="s1">so the user will not have to manually prioritise each event and todo task. ToDos</span>
<span class="s1">are listed at the front of each day as they do not have an included time.</span>

<span class="s0">=== Budget handling system :</span>

<span class="s1">The system allows for the user to handle their own monthly budget. There is a set budget</span>
<span class="s1">for each month (fixed at $50 initially) that stops users from entering new concerts into</span>
<span class="s1">the schedule if that new concert would cause the costs of concerts for the month to exceed</span>
<span class="s1">the stipulated budget.</span>

<span class="s1">For example, if the list contains a concert on the 4th of July, 2019 that costs $49,</span>
<span class="s1">entering a new concert that costs more than a dollar would causes the system to cancel the</span>
<span class="s1">operation as it would lead to monthly costs of $51 that exceeds the monthly budget of $50.</span>

<span class="s1">The user also has the ability to change the stipulated budget for each month or universally if</span>
<span class="s1">he/she wishes to.</span>

<span class="s0">=== Reminder for specific task types : `[coming v2.0]`</span>

<span class="s1">The user will be able to get reminders of specific task type using the reminder command</span>
<span class="s1">and specifying which type they would like to be displayed. </span><span class="s0">+ 
</span>
<span class="s1">E.g. “reminder exam”</span>
<span class="s1">displays a reminder of all exam events within the next 3 days.</span>

<span class="s0">== FAQ</span>
